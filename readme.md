# PUBG challenges Discord bot

PUBG challenges Discord bot is a small interactive bot that allows players to get a random bot when typing `.challenge`

If the players like the challenge, they can react with a 'üëç' and a random user will be chosen to pay for the next season passes if they succeed.
